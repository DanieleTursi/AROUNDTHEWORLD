    <p>
      Where to go is one of the first question you should ask yourself as soon as you are planning to go somewhere.
      <br>The world is big and people think that the asnwer to this question it can be immediate, but in reality this is not.
      <br><strong>Why is there not an instant answer to this question?</strong>
      <br>You may already seen most of the places which were in your bucket list or you still have so many but you can't pick one. An other reason can be that you have the answer but the place you want to go is out of your budget at the moment.
      <br><strong>AROUNDTHEWORLD will help you.</strong> 
    </p>
    <h3>-What am I looking for and What is my budget?-</h3>

    <p>
      What are you looking for is something that you have to know before to think about a destination.
      <br> You may are looking for a place where you can relax or a place where you can have fun. Either of those will not the answer as you can relax on a hot beach or a chilly mountain.
      You should think if you want to visit a crowdy place or be somewhere where you will not have to stay in big crowds.
      <br> How much you are willing to spent for your holiday and what you aspect to have with this budget, for example: you have a 100 dollars budget per day, what you can do with those money in Amalfi Coast(Italy) is less than what you can do with the same budget in Algarve(Portugal).
      <br><strong>AROUNDTHEWORLD will ask you different questions and will give you the destination you are looking for.</strong>
